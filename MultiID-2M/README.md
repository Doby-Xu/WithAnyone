- `ref/cluster_centers.tar`: Contains the cluster centers of all the identifiable identities in the dataset.
- `ref/tars`: Contains the reference images for each identifiable identity.
- `train_cp`: Contains the training images only of the identifiable identities.
- `train_rec`: Contains the training images of both identifiable and unidentifiable identities.

<!-- ## Labels and Captions -->
## Labels
The dataset contains dense labels for each image, including:
- `url`: The original URL of the original image.
- `ram_score`: Scores from recognize anything model.
- `bboxes`: Bounding boxes of detected faces.
- `aesthetics_score`: Aesthetic score of the image.
- `caption_en`: English caption generated by VLMs.
- `name`: ID number of the identifiable identity (if identifiable, otherwise `none`).
- `embeddings` (or `embedding`): Face embeddings extracted using ArcFace antelopev2 model. This corresponds to the bboxes.

## How to Use

Minimal example coming soon.

You can load the tars directly using `webdataset`.
